1. Function to POST data from the endpoint '/admin' to the db
2. Need a seperate endpoint or not? For seprate endpoint, the front end should be configured to redirect to that endpoint(admin)
3. app.POST('/admin', async(req,res) => {
    try{

    }
    catch{
        error
    }
})
4. New db collection to be defined each time? Or shall I let it to define on default?

Succesfully sent the data to mongodb and I can view them in the collections (Tested with Insomnia)
Since I created the schema in a way that each question and answer set is shown as different queries. Should I keep them as it is or should I capture all the question sets in a single query?
-- Need to verify if end user can fetch an entire collection or one query at a time?
   An entire collection can be called. I have to review more about fetching this API
